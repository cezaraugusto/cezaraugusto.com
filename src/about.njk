## Where it all started

My interest in programming started back in 2001 when I saw a friend playing with Visual Basic inside MSExcel. A few moons later, I discovered web development and started making blog templates. A decade went by before I could start making any money out of it.

Nowadays, I don't make blog templates anymore, but the passion for web development got me involved in browsers and drives most of the content I create. During my career, I've worked with a wide range of applications, web apps, mobile apps, dApps, desktop apps, and contributed to open-source libraries and apps used by millions of developers such as [React.js](http://react.dev), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), and [Brave](https://brave.com).

## This blog

Here I share my thoughts on development and my views on everything. I used to write about software development on Quora, where I earned the [Quora Top Writer award in 2021](https://pt.quora.com/Cezar-Augusto), but as things move and the world turns, this blog is a centralized platform I can control.

## Fun facts about me

I'm a retired [Brazilian Army Paratrooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper) and used to be an [Intelligence Analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_analysis), working during events such as the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.

## Location

I'm based in the southeast of ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Brazil, born and raised in Rio de Janeiro.

## Speaking

If you want me to present or speak at your event send me a message via <code class="email">window.atob(&quot;Ym9zc0BjZXphcmF1Z3VzdG8ubmV0&quot;)</code> (mind the quotes). You can also reach me over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto) though I'm not as responsive as the email option.
