I have a builder mentality and like to build things so people can feel empowered and ready to make the real job done. I coined the term <mark>building for the builders</mark> as a quick answer to what I really like to do.

## Some history

I started getting interested in programming back in 2001 after seeing a friend playing with Visual Basic inside MSExcel. Soon after I discovered that you could build for the internet and discovered what I'm passionate about. This was kept as a hobby for the next 11 years until I started doing it professionally. Before working on the web I worked as an [Inteligence Analyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_analysis) and prior to that as an [Army Paratrooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper).

## Speaking

I sporadically give talks in topics that I'm interested, being them web platform tech as a whole, web performance and privacy issues.

If you want me to present or speak at your event send me a message via <code class="email">window.atob('Ym9zc0BjZXphcmF1Z3VzdG8ubmV0')</code>. You can also reach me over [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto) though I'm not as responsive as the email option.

## Location ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

I'm based in the southeast of Brazil, born and raised in Rio de Janeiro.
