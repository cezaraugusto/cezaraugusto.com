There it is, a blog. This task is likely the oldest one in my to-do list. On average took me ~18 years -- it was my first task when I started developing bad sites with XHTML -- to make it. Now it is done.

Countless unfished articles, infinite tweaks on different static sites, a frustrated plan to have one hosted on Medium and sleepless nights searching and tweaking the interface I wanted. Feels good to have one to call mine :)

The plans for this is to write about the lots of readings and the little I know about random web development, producing software, random ideas and opinionated best practices.

Way to go!
