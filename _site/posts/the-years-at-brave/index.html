<p>The first moment I saw Brave, I wanted to be associated with it. They were a small team with a vision working on an open-source project <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop">written in JavaScript</a>. It was 2016.</p>
<p>On May 15th, 2020, it was my last day working for Brave.</p>
<p>I took my time to reflect on what happened in these last four years. A relationship of four years is something. You can’t hide me from your mother for that long.</p>
<p>This blog post is about me, and Brave, and the last four years.</p>
<h2 id="2016" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#2016"><span>2016</span></a></h2>
<p>It all started in 2016. I liked Brave from the start. I saw a tweet, tried it, liked it. The desktop browser was still raw, but I liked the initiative and wanted to help somehow. I thought it would be cool to start by retweeting their updates.</p>
<p>I think it started with this tweet.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Windows friends: Looking for a fast, safe, beautiful and way cool browser? Switch to <a href="https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brave</a> 🦁👌 <a href="https://t.co/hiAYYZTjmZ">https://t.co/hiAYYZTjmZ</a></p>&mdash; Cezar Augusto (@cezaraugusto) <a href="https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto/status/723541059268173826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Which Brave later retweeted:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Time to switch! <a href="https://t.co/GhlmA8tz96">https://t.co/GhlmA8tz96</a></p>&mdash; Brave (@brave) <a href="https://twitter.com/brave/status/723542469862805506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2016</a></blockquote>
<p>Social media has this magic power. This retweet made me feel good and validated, and that action motivated me to keep helping their product somehow.</p>
<p>At the time, Brave had less than 10 engineers working on their desktop browser, but their pile of issues was increasing fast. To this day, <strong>I’ve never seemed a project with so many issues reported</strong> (massive 11,978 issues, of which <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+%40cezaraugusto">11,310 somehow tag my username</a>). So I thought it would be wise to start with bug triaging until I could figure out how the project works.</p>
<p>After a few weeks reporting bugs and hacking around, on June 2, 2016, I <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/1907">sent my first pull-request</a>. I still remember the feeling of opening the packaged software, installing it, and seeing the feature I added live in the release channel, for everybody to download. I think I asked around five people to download BRave too, so they could try out my proud contribution.</p>

<p>You could now print a web page from the context menu.</p>
<p>Eight days later, <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/2038">another pull-request</a>.</p>

      <img class="m-auto" src="/static/images/posts/post-004/002.jpg" alt="" />
    </div>
  </figure>
<p><strong>I got engaged.</strong> I kept contributing. There is this magical feeling of working on open-source initiatives where your code ends up serving several (I guess tens of thousands, at the time) people.</p>
<p>Can you believe that <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/2644">one of my pull-requests</a> ended up featured in a tweet from Brave’s CTO, <a href="https://twitter.com/brianbondy">Brian R. Bondy</a>? I was just another contributor (Brave had many at the time), but hey, I was being noticed!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some nice animation polish done by a <a href="https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cezaraugusto</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brave</a> 0.11.2 :D Thanks for the contributions! <a href="https://t.co/XSWvXOxL2f">pic.twitter.com/XSWvXOxL2f</a></p>&mdash; Brian R.

<p>I was lucky that Brian found value in my contributions, questionings, and genuine willingness to make the browser software better. After a few months contributing code as an outside collaborator, this happened:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happiest tweet ever: Starting today, I&#39;m joining the awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brave</a> team. 🦁 🏆</p>&mdash; Cezar Augusto (@cezaraugusto) <a href="https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto/status/771351046853627904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>My most significant contribution to Brave at the time also came in around the same time. I was the lucky person responsible for implementing the most visited and iconic page on Brave, the <strong>new tab page</strong>.</p>

    <figcaption>This is what NTP looked like at the time in the prototype I built. Brave used to have 3 rows of top sites.</figcaption>
  </figure>
<p>And that’s all for 2016. There I was, a proud new member of the Brave crew. Feeling proud, shipping the most visited page a browser has, doing open-source for a living, living the dream. This year was 2016.</p>

  </figure>
<p>At the time, the desktop browser was having several performance issues, so the team decided to gather together to fix them (we did) in Chicago. There I also had the chance to help to interview a candidate for Brave for the first time. I find job interviews fascinating (still do, at least the principles I try to apply to them) — a positive experience. I would later help with other interviews a few more times.</p>
<p>There, I also had the chance to be featured live, representing Brave, for the first time. It was a chat we had with the fine folks of <a href="https://twitter.com/IndoBrave/">Brave Indonesia</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of representing Brave, and still speaking about first-times, this year I had the chance to <a href="https://twitter.com/brave/status/903761397154160640">speak at a conference</a> to talk about Brave. It was at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171004170021/https://braziljs.org/conf/">BrazilJS in 2017</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="pt" dir="ltr">O que a brave pode melhorar a web. <a href="https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brave</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cezaraugusto</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/braziljs2017?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#braziljs2017</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/braziljs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#braziljs</a> <a href="https://t.co/hx88o1tc8e">pic.twitter.com/hx88o1tc8e</a></p>&mdash; Daniel Bastos 🇧🇷 (@danielbastos) <a href="https://twitter.com/danielbastos/status/904062303875846144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>This year had me working mostly on tab features. Brave used to have tab pages, a set of visible tabs you could accumulate. At the time, you could add up to 20 tabs per tab group. We take tabs in browsers for granted, but tabs are a real complex mechanism. <em>Have you ever thought that tabs need to be responsive?</em> <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/6900">I did</a>, and literally, added support for <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/7695">a hundred of tabs</a>.</p>
<p>I was also lucky to be the person to implement two new, important pages. The <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/8074">private new tab</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/8097d">the welcome page</a>.</p>
<p>The year also had me started working in parallel on the desktop browser migration from <a href="https://github.com/brave/muon">Muon</a> (a fork of Electron) to <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-browser">Chromium</a>. Mainly on the <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-extension/">Brave Shields</a> port, my favorite part of Brave.</p>
<p>During the migration process, I realized this was the ideal time to create a component library that could be reused across products. I wanted to make something new and somehow make the refactoring more fun. Over one weekend, I created a proof-of-concept work and shared it with a few peers who thought it was a good idea. One week later, I <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-ui/commit/b1b71393d429349243916e13b34e35edc238161">pushed the first commit</a> of what would be called <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-ui">brave-ui</a>. A set of reusable React components that accomplished the goal of having a shareable interface across Brave products. The project would later inspire the formation of a design system (months before <em>design systems</em> were cool and somewhat common).</p>
<p>Doing performance work, help conducting a job interview, speaking in a great conference about Brave, several fixes for browser tabs, two new browser pages, a component library shared across the company’s product. The year of 2017 was full of accomplishments. I was ready for the next.</p>

  </figure>
<p>This year I started working full-time on the port of the desktop codebase. I was one of the first engineers to work on this initiative. At the time, I was working on the <a href="https://github.com/brave/browser-laptop/pull/13197">V2 version</a> of Sync, delayed in favor of the Chromium migration.</p>
<p>The new browser was great. I was excited to work on top of Chromium. My work started with me <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/105">porting</a> the private new tab, <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/256">and later</a> the brand new welcome page. Later, Sync V2 <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/1019">eventually featured</a> in the Chromium version.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="/static/images/posts/post-004/007.jpg">

    This is how the welcome page looked like back in the days.

</figure>
<p>Another speaking opportunity came in, and in October, I spoke at <a href="https://www.conexaokinghost.com.br/">Conexão KingHost</a> to talk about Brave, digital ads, and blockchain. The event happened online. If I recall correctly, it had 5k+ subscribers for the edition.</p>
<p>The event was a great, funny, joyful experience, where I get the chance to know the dedicated and talented people behind <a href="https://twitter.com/kinghost">@kinghost</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, I also had the chance to help to mentor two talented engineering interns. We talked a lot about bugs, tests, life, and I was able to help and see them grow in confidence as they shipped valuable code.</p>
<p>Mentoring is one of my favorite things about programming, and I’m happy I had this chance many times at Brave, with both juniors and seniors from other teams. Who in this world never bargained Polymer skills for some C++ guidance?</p>
<p>Working full-time on the new desktop version was exciting. Sync V2 took a huge amount of time and effort to land for several reasons, and I felt relieved <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/1019">when it landed</a>. Sync was one of the most wanted features in the new Brave version.</p>
<p>Speaking at a conference again gave me a confidence boost that positively reflected in my daily work. The new browser felt great. Users were happy. Could I ask for more?</p>
<p>It was 2018.</p>

Great stuff is coming up for all of you fighting for a better web! <a href="https://t.co/IGRIO2yxTK">pic.twitter.com/IGRIO2yxTK</a></p>&mdash; Cezar Augusto (@cezaraugusto) <a href="https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto/status/1105975164704116736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>The year started with me working on some Sync bugs. I <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/2874">pushed a change</a> that got Shields a brand new interface. Shields and Sync dictated the rest of the year.</p>
<p>This year I got another chance to help interns at Brave, but now taking full ownership of the whole interview process (up to where I’m legally allowed). From picking up a candidate from the list, passing through technical and social interviewing, to job offer. An incredible experience. I was lucky to pick up a talented front-end engineer to mentor. We had fun times and shipped quality software. Mentoring is fun.</p>
<p>My only regret is not having a picture to share. I went to San Francisco again to meet them and got to know the new company office. SF is great. I got to eat at the famous Fogo de Chao, took a daily city walk, got lost a couple of times. Fun!</p>
<p>In October, I got the chance to work on a cool feature that would ask if you want to load an archived version of an error page — using the Wayback Machine API (where I coined the name <em>Braveback</em> Machine). <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/3561">The work</a> started as a browser extension, and eventually, my peer <a href="https://twitter.com/simonhong33">@simonhong33</a> ported it to C++, for maximum performance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Available on <a href="https://twitter.com/brave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brave</a> nightly: check if a missing website has an archived version available in <a href="https://t.co/JQMrtsJ5KA">https://t.co/JQMrtsJ5KA</a>. Solid work I got the chance to do with my talented peers <a href="https://twitter.com/simonhong33?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@simonhong33</a>, Karen, and <a href="https://twitter.com/rebron?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@rebron</a>. <a href="https://t.co/BM5r9aoTxx">pic.twitter.com/BM5r9aoTxx</a></p>&mdash; Cezar Augusto (@cezaraugusto) <a href="https://twitter.com/cezaraugusto/status/1207701750960050177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Sync, Shields, interviewing, management, mentoring, Wayback Machine.</p>
<p>Bye 2019.</p>
<h2 id="2020" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#2020"><span>2020</span></a></h2>
<p>The year started with me finally managing to work on my dream issue, <a href="https://github.com/brave/brave-core/pull/4325">a long-needed refactor of new tab page’s top sites</a>, along with some other features and bugs. This task was my short movie version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(2020_TV_series)"><em>The Last Dance</em></a>. Me and Brave shaked hands formally for the last time a few months after this change landed.</p>
<p>At Brave, I got to know a lot of talented people, helped shape the desktop software as it is known today, spoke the good news about the company for a large audience, mentored peers, interviewed people, managed people, had fun.</p>
<p>Saying goodbye is never easy, but as I finish this blog post, I’m thankful to say that the only memories I have at my time on Brave are happy.</p>
<p>Some people like to work for big companies. Some people like to work to make companies big. I feel rewarded seeing Brave growing strong every year. With about <a href="https://brave.com/brave-passes-10m-mau/">ten million</a> monthly active users, Brave is not small anymore, by any means. I can’t help but smile and feel thankful that ten million people are every month, seeing, interacting, and using features made with a code I co-created.</p>
<p>Brave is making history, and I’m proud to say I’m part of it.</p>
<p>Onwards!</p>
<p>Dear Brave Software, thank you!</p>
